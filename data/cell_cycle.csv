State,Phase,Abbreviation,Description
Resting,Gap 0,G0,A phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing.
Interphase,Gap 1,G1,Cells increase in size in Gap 1. The G1 checkpoint control mechanism ensures that everything is ready for DNA synthesis.
Interphase,Synthesis,S,DNA replication occurs during this phase.
Interphase,Gap 2,G2,"During the gap between DNA synthesis and mitosis, the cell will continue to grow. The G2 checkpoint control mechanism ensures that everything is ready to enter the M (mitosis) phase and divide."
Cell division,Mitosis,M,Cell growth stops at this stage and cellular energy is focused on the orderly division into two daughter cells. A checkpoint in the middle of mitosis (Metaphase Checkpoint) ensures that the cell is ready to complete cell division.
