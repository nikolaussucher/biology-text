Name(s),Scope,Description
"Land plants, also known as Embryophyta",Plantae sensu strictissimo,"Plants in the strictest sense include the liverworts, hornworts, mosses, and vascular plants, as well as fossil plants similar to these surviving groups."
"Green plants, also known as Viridiplantae, Viridiphyta, Chlorobionta or Chloroplastida",Plantae sensu stricto,"Plants in a strict sense include the green algae, and land plants that emerged within them, including stoneworts. The relationships between plant groups are still being worked out, and the names given to them vary considerably. The clade Viridiplantae encompasses a group of organisms that have cellulose in their cell walls, possess chlorophylls a and b and have plastids bound by only two membranes that are capable of photosynthesis and of storing starch. This clade is the main subject of this article."
"Archaeplastida, also known as Plastida or Primoplantae",Plantae sensu lato,"Plants in a broad sense comprise the green plants listed above plus the red algae (Rhodophyta) and the glaucophyte algae (Glaucophyta) that store Floridean starch outside the plastids, in the cytoplasm. This clade includes all of the organisms that eons ago acquired their primary chloroplasts directly by engulfing cyanobacteria(e.g., Plantae Cavalier-Smith, 1981)."
Old definitions of plant (obsolete),Plantae sensu amplo,"Plants in the widest sense refers to older, obsolete classifications that placed diverse algae, fungi or bacteria in Plantae."
